The project is the realization of ideas of team 'Lemon Drop' in the 'Javascript UI & DOM' course for a slightly more difficult and frustrating game.

The war of wizards is a never-ending one. An unfortunate wizard's apprentice was caught in the crossfire and eventually ended up banished in a dungeon for the rest of his life with nothing more than a staff that emits little light and his knowledge of conjuring boxes!
Players must take the role of the conjurer and create boxes in order to overcome obstacles and reach the next level of the dungeon.

The conjurer walks on his own, he can jump over 1-tile high solid blocks and continue moving on in the direction that he is facing. Should he face a higher wall he will turn around and start walking in the opposite direction. Spikes and flames will take away a life point and send him back to the beginning of the current level. Conjuring a box on top of the character will also kill him!

CONTROLS:

SPACEBAR - stops and resumes character's movement

LMB - clicking anywhere on a vacant spot will create a box that the conjurer can use to climb or walk on
